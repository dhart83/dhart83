# Donnie Hartman

**Embedded Software & Firmware Engineer**  
Working at the software–hardware boundary across real-time, embedded, and FPGA/SoC systems.

## About

I work on low-level, hardware-integrated systems where correctness, timing, and observability matter. My background spans embedded firmware, RTOS-based systems, FPGA development, and hardware-software integration, with experience contributing to reliability-critical and regulated programs.

Professionally, I’ve supported and contributed to FPGA-based data transport systems, safety-critical avionics platforms, and verification infrastructure as part of cross-disciplinary engineering teams. My work has included RTL development, timing and CDC analysis, UVM-based verification, and Python-driven automation.

I’m particularly interested in systems that behave deterministically under real-world constraints and in understanding how software, firmware, and hardware interact at their boundaries.

## Focus Areas

**Embedded & Systems Software**

- C / C++, RTOS fundamentals, interrupts, concurrency
- Bare-metal and Linux user-space development
- Hardware–software integration and low-level debugging

**FPGA & Hardware Platforms**

- VHDL / Verilog / SystemVerilog
- UVM-based verification
- Timing, clocking, CDC, and streaming data paths
- High-throughput Ethernet systems using vendor IP

**Verification, Tooling & Automation**

- Python-based test and regression automation
- CI/CD workflows (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- Linting, CDC analysis, and design review support
- DO-254 processes and requirements traceability

## Selected Work

The repositories here reflect how I approach systems problems: understanding behavior, validating assumptions, and integrating across layers. Some projects are exploratory by design; others are more complete and representative.

- **Custom Preemptive RTOS (ARM Cortex-M)**
  Implemented a small preemptive scheduler, context switching, and synchronization primitives to explore real-time behavior and interrupt-driven systems.

- **Self-Balancing Robot (MSP432 + Custom PCBs)**
  Embedded control system combining firmware, custom hardware, and real-time PID control for an inverted-pendulum platform.

- **32-bit MIPS CPU Core (VHDL)**
  Modular processor core focusing on datapath design, control logic, and deterministic execution verified through simulation. -->
